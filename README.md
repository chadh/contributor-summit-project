# Puppet Contributor Summit Online Project

## Charter

### Mission

Learn enough about bolt and/or GCP modules to setup training environment in Google Cloud

### End users

Students of training courses (in particular, those of an internal puppet bootcamp I am running in Q1 2019)

### Vision

Instructors have a straght-forward way to define infrastructures so that students can focus on just he learning objectives.

### Success criteria

There are really two objectives, particularly for this one month activity.  Success for the CSO is an MVP/POC that shows this will be helpful for my bootcamp.  Success for the larger project is a tool that will set up a training environment, successful use of it during the bootcamp, and positive survey results about that use.  Stretch goal would be creating something that the community also finds valuable in other situations.

### Constraints

Only constraint is time.  I have support to work on this, but my focused project time is limited.

### Team members

Just me, for now.
